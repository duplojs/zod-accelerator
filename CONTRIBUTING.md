# Contributing
To begin, thank you very much for agreeing to contribute to this project! Your participation will surely be a great help to me.

For our collaboration to be sustainable, I kindly ask you to follow a few rules to formalize our work within this project.

## In Issues
If you have a suggestion for new features or a bug to report, feel free to create an issue.  
The only format to follow is in the title:  
- For a feature: **'feat: your topic'**  
- For a bug: **'fix: your topic'**

You can also use the template.

## Create branch
For branch creation, please follow this format: **(fix|feat)\\/issue-number**

Exemple: 
- feat/11
- fix/42 

## In pull request
For pull requests, their names should be formalized with the following this:  **(fix|feat)\\(issue-number\\): your-subject**

Exemple: 
- feat(11): add this feature
- fix(42): some bug
